# Stepupfitness2024
A program by the Followmysteps non-profit organization to promote healthier eating and fitness lifestyles for the youth. This is detailing the metrics captured during the 7 week program.

# Goals
The overall goal of the program is teach the youth about healthier methods to cook and prepare food, while giving them access to fitness sessions to get them familar to an active lifestyle. Also, training them for a Mentoring Matters 5k towards the end of the program. 

# Metrics
For each week of the program, each youth recorded meals and etc. to the best of their abilities on a sheet. Then I would record each day for each week in Excel tables for better organization and later on for visualizing the data. Metrics recorded were: 
  * Sleep in hours
  * Breakfast
  * Snack 1
  * Lunch
  * Snack 2
  * Dinner
  * Snack 3
  * Water intake in cups
  * Was there a workout done this day?
  * Stretching time in minutes

You can find the tables for each week in the repository marked as FollowmystepsWeek(week number).
